**Analytical Flavor Systems: 2014-Present**

*Lead Engineer*

We use data mining techniques to find flavor profiles of various artisan products.  From that we can do quality control tests on the data to find any minute changes in the flavor from batch to batch and week to week.  I was the lead engineer on the team working on maintaining all servers and make sure everything works in our data pipeline. 



* Use R to process all reviews

* Use Kubernetes to run all servers as cluster. Scale up or down R processes based on reviews coming in.

* Use Golang and AWS SQS to run a pipeline of messages along key points.
